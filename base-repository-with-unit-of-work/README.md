# Base Repository and Unit of Work Patterns

This example demonstrates the implementation of the Base Repository and Unit of Work patterns in a .NET application. These patterns are used to create a more maintainable and testable data access layer.

## Base Repository

The Base Repository pattern provides a generic repository that can be used for CRUD operations on any entity. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for data access and promotes code reuse.

### Key Features:
- Generic methods for common data operations (e.g., Add, Update, Delete, GetById, GetAll).
- Simplifies data access logic by centralizing it in a single class.

## Unit of Work

The Unit of Work pattern maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes. It ensures that all changes are committed as a single transaction, providing a way to manage database operations more efficiently.

### Key Features:
- Manages transactions and ensures data consistency.
- Coordinates the work of multiple repositories.
- Reduces the risk of data inconsistencies by handling commit and rollback operations.

## Example Structure

```
/BaseRepository
    - IRepository.cs
    - Repository.cs
/UnitOfWork
    - IUnitOfWork.cs
    - UnitOfWork.cs
/Entities
    - Entity.cs
    - OtherEntity.cs
/Services
    - EntityService.cs
    - OtherEntityService.cs
```

## Usage

1. **Define Entities**: Create your entity classes in the `Entities` folder.
2. **Create Repositories**: Implement the `IRepository` interface in the `Repository` class.
3. **Implement Unit of Work**: Implement the `IUnitOfWork` interface in the `UnitOfWork` class.
4. **Use in Services**: Inject the `IUnitOfWork` into your service classes to perform data operations.

By following these patterns, you can create a clean and maintainable data access layer that is easy to test and extend.
